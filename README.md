# Approximation
This is a project of a program that selects the optimal coefficients of a straight line for a given set of points. After the experiment, we have a certain set of dependencies, using the least squares method, we can approximate it and find the optimal curve that is minimally different from the broken line connecting all points.
This project will be especially useful for any mipt's student in the processing of laboratory work. We have tried to make the interface as clear and friendly as possible, and the program itself is safe and fast. If you have any awards and advice, feel free to contact the developers.
Best wishes, Nikolai Kovalenko and Elizaveta Ezhova.
